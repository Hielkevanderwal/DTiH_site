    This digital twin provides an analysis for patients with concerns regarding atrial fibrillation. The data that is used for the digital twin consists of two elements: lifestyle-data (BMI-value, ADS and CDS questionnaire result) and PPG-data. The PPG-data is collected using a sensor (for testing a FreeSense earbud was used) and can be uploaded in the model. We combine these values for a calculation using a formula that gives each factor a certain weight, according to medical literature. The outcome of this is a personal risk-factor regarding the development of atrial fibrillation and some feedback including an advice concerning the lifestyle factors.

    In order to use this website you have to login via either a patient or doctor profile. Patients have to fill in three questionnaire from which the lifestyle data is collected. The first one focusses on BMI (Body Mass Index), so the patients length and mass is needed. The second and third questionnaire give insight in drinking and smoking behaviour according to the standardized ADS and CDS scoring system. Patients can see in their to-do-list which questionnaires are not filled in yet. When the PPG-data is collected the doctor can use the website to calculate the risk-factor for each of his patients. The patient can from now on see the results of the medical examination in their dashboard, but of course this website can also be used when these results are discussed in a personal meeting between the doctor and patient. From that moment the doctor will decide whether a surgery is needed or that the patient is still in a stage where changes in lifestyle will prevent this. The digital twin will support this with additional feedback. This process can be repeated on every medical check-up to facilitate a continuous flow of input in the digital twin to gain insight in the current status of the patient.Â
